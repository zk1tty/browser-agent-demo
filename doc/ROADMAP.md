# Roadmap

## Motivation ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüî•

Browser-use is an amazing library that leverages LLM capabilities to control browsers.   
However, when applying LLM Agents to real-world browsing tasks, I discovered many missing pieces that need to be addressed.   
At Rebrowse, we are bridging the gap between powerful libraries and real-world use cases, making it intuitive and accessible for everyone, even your grandma, to use out of the box.    

## End Game üéØ

I am building Rebrowse to become the "Twitch for AI Creators."   

A marketplace where AI creators can share their combinations of AI tools, creating the following flywheel:

- AI Creators can generate income by sharing AI workflows.   
- Users can execute workflows with a single click.
- AI tool companies can discover high-quality AI creators and delegate community building to them.
