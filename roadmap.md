# project Rebrowse

## Motivation

Browser-use is an amazing library to leverage the capavility of LLM to contorl browser.   
However, applying LLM Agent to real-world browing tasks, I found that so many missing pieces should be filled in.   
At Rebrowse, we will conenct the gap of powerful library and real-workd use cases where anyone, like your grandma, can use it out of the box very intuitively.
