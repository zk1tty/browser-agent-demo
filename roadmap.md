# Roadmap

## Motivation ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüî•

Browser-use is an amazing library to leverage the capability of LLM to control browser.   
However, applying LLM Agent to real-world browsing tasks, I found that so many missing pieces should be filled in.   
At Rebrowse, we will connect the gap between powerful library and real-world use cases where anyone, like your grandma, can use it out of the box very intuitively.    

## End Game üéØ

I will make Rebrowse "Twitch for AI Creators."   

A marketplace for AI creators to share their combinations of AI tools. That generates the following flywheel:

- AI Creators can earn profile by sharing AI workflows.   
- Users can execute their workflow by one-click.
- AI tool companies find high-quality AI creators and delegate them community building.

## Key insights from users ‚úçüèª

My key insights are below:

- Finding right prompts to get high quality output is hard.   
   - make UI so simple. Just choose the template
- Identifying workflows is not easy for customers.   
   - target businesses first.
- Business people have better ideas.
  - They delegate cheap freelancers to operate the specific tasks, and ask them for reports.
